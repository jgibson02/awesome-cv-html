This is a port of the Awesome-CV resume template, originally created by posquit0 in LaTeX, to HTML+CSS. This project uses Mustache.js for convenient templating, and Gulp as a build system and task runner.

If you would like to use this template for your own resume, simply clone this repo, open up a terminal, and run `npm install` to install all package dependencies. Then, run `gulp` to begin the build process and see the output in your browser. Replace the preexisting information found in `/src/data.json` with your own and it will display live in your browser.
