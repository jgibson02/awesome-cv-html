This is a port of the Awesome-CV resume template, originally created by posquit0 in LaTeX, to HTML+CSS. This project uses Mustache.js for convenient templating, and Gulp as a build system and task runner. While it does not cover all of the sections that are available in posquit0's original source, and although it focuses only on the resume portion of the template, the framework is there to easilly extend the format.

If you would like to use this template for your own resume, simply clone this repo, open up a terminal, and run `npm install` to install all package dependencies. Then, run `gulp` to begin the build process and see the output in your browser. Replace the preexisting information found in `/src/resume-data.json` with your own and it will display live in your browser.

Original template: [posquit0/Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)
